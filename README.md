## About Me ðŸ‘‹

My name is Myles Robinson and I am a MS in AI Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University set to graduate in December 2025. My focuses are in computer vision and wearable health technologies as they have the potential to impact human daily-living through the application of state-of-the-art ML techniques. I am also very much interested in the performance vs. cost trade-offs of today's powerful ML/DL models and aim to be conscious of training and inference costs when designing architectures of my own.

## Projects & Work Experience

### IMU-based Activity Recognition

### Gesture-based Screen Control Using Sapiens Pose Estimation

### Predictive Maintenance Project @ Apple
At Apple's manufacturing facilities, unexpected machine downtime was causing significant production losses, decreased operational efficiency, and higher capital and operational costs, ultimately impacting product revenue. To address this challenge, I developed a scalable predictive maintenance system using LSTM neural networks that processes and analyzes data from hundreds of manufacturing machines. The solution accurately identified high-risk equipment likely to experience downtime, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling before failures occur. This system was designed to scale seamlessly across multiple product lines including iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac. The implementation demonstrated the value of smart manufacturing through predictive maintenance, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per factory while improving production line reliability and maintenance resource allocation. The successful proof-of-concept established a foundation for expanded implementation across Apple's international manufacturing network.
