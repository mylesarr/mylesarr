## About Me ðŸ‘‹

My name is Myles Robinson and I am a MS in AI Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University set to graduate in December 2025. My focuses are in computer vision and wearable health technologies as they have the potential to impact human daily-living through the application of state-of-the-art ML techniques. I am also very much interested in the performance vs. cost trade-offs of today's powerful ML/DL models and aim to be conscious of training and inference costs when designing architectures of my own.
