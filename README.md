## About Me ðŸ‘‹

My name is Myles Robinson and I am a MS in AI Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University set to graduate in December 2025. My focuses are in computer vision and wearable health technologies as they have the potential to impact human daily-living through the application of state-of-the-art ML techniques. I am also very much interested in the performance vs. cost trade-offs of today's powerful ML/DL models and aim to be conscious of training and inference costs when designing architectures of my own.

## Projects & Work Experience

### IMU-based Activity Recognition
While smartwatches and other wearables can detect basic physical activities like walking and running, emerging wearable devices come in diverse formfactors and are worn on different parts of the body, making many existing activity classifiers less universally applicable. Furthermore, most commercial models are closed source (e.g., Apple), with limited transparency around accuracy. This poses challenges for clinical adoption where openness and reliability are critical. To address these limitations, I evaluated previously developed open-source classifiers for physical activity recognition using my own data and extended the models to cover activities of daily living (i.e. walking, running, and stair climbing) as well as exercises like squats, counterjumps, step-ups, and more. Specifically, I enhanced a ResNet-based model by appending a self-supervised convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction, which improved performance significantly. This final model outperformed ___ competitors by ___% across 37 unique exercises.

### Gesture-based Screen Control: A Generalizable Solution
I developed a lightweight model for live gesture recognition designed for real-time performance in diverse settings. While existing solutions often require significant compute and fail to generalize across users and environments, my model achieves higher accuracy, faster inference, and greater robustness. This makes it ideal for applications in assistive technology, gaming, AR/VR interfaces, automotive controls, and smart environments.


### Predictive Maintenance Project @ Apple
At Apple's manufacturing facilities, unexpected machine downtime was causing significant production losses, decreased operational efficiency, and higher capital and operational costs, ultimately impacting product revenue. To address this challenge, I developed a scalable predictive maintenance system using LSTM neural networks that processes and analyzes data from hundreds of manufacturing machines. The solution accurately identified high-risk equipment likely to experience downtime, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling before failures occur. This system was designed to scale seamlessly across multiple product lines including iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac. The implementation demonstrated the value of smart manufacturing through predictive maintenance, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per factory while improving production line reliability and maintenance resource allocation. The successful proof-of-concept established a foundation for expanded implementation across Apple's international manufacturing network.
